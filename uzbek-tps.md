- Lessons from Toyota Production System
- Shehzadeh Nayyar Jehan

## Modern Measures of Industrial Efficiency[^1][^2]
- **Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)**
  - A valuable measure of productive efficiency
- **Machine Intelligence (MI)** and **Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)**
  - Transformative approach to industrial efficiency
- **Design of Experiments (DOE)** and **Business Analytics (BA)**
  - Data-driven decision making and process optimization

## Assessing Efficiency and Sustainability[^3][^4]
- **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**
  - A framework for industrial efficiency and sustainability
- **Environmental Impact (EI)**
  - A crucial consideration for sustainable industrial growth
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
  - Comprehensive picture of industrial and organizational performance

## Toyota Production System (TPS) Overview[^5][^6]
- Integrates modern measures of industrial efficiency
  - OEE, MI, ERP, DOE, BA, KPIs, and SDGs
- An approach that addresses industrial efficiency *comprehensively*
  - Recognized as a successful system

## Relevance and Feasibility of TPS
- Ideal for implementation in Uzbekistan's industrial sector
- Incorporates most of the modern measures into its design
- Offers a *comprehensive framework* for improving efficiency

## Importance of a Comprehensive Framework
- Traditional measures of industrial efficiency no longer sufficient
  - Solely comparing input with output is limiting
- An all-encompassing framework needed
  - Incorporates OEE, MI, ERP, DOE, BA, KPIs, and SDGs

## TPS as an Ideal Choice
- Integrates most modern measures into its design
- Offers a *comprehensive approach* to industrial efficiency
- Can be applied to Uzbekistan's industrial sector for better productivity and resource efficiency

## Industrial Efficiency in Uzbekistan[^7][^8][^9]
- Economic changes since 2016
  - Focus on improving industrial and resource utilization efficiency
- Government efforts to open up sectors
  - Steady economic growth rates
- Presidential decree issued on June 13, 2022[^10]
  - Efficiently utilizing special economic zones

## Key Industrial Sectors in Uzbekistan[^11]
- Base metals
- Food products
- Textiles
- Motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers
- Mining
- Electricity, gas, steam, and air conditioning
- Chemical substances and chemical products
- Other mineral non-metal products
- Coke and petroleum products
- Apparel
- Electric equipment
- Beverages
- Rubber and polymer products
- Finished metal products (except machines and equipment)
- Machines and equipment (not classified under other categories)

## Challenges in Uzbekistan's Industrial Sector[^12]
- Supply chain management issues
- Outdated production floor designs
- Inadequate IT networks
- Insufficient knowledge of modern production techniques and technologies
  - Ineffective cost and workforce management

## Adopting Modern Production Management Practices[^13]
- Align with Industry 4.0 demands
- TPS as a viable solution
  - Optimize production management
- Prioritize adoption of advanced practices
  - Remain competitive in a globalized economy
- TPS enables systematic approach
  - Optimize production efficiency, minimize waste, improve product quality

## The Toyota Production System[^14]
- Pioneer of lean manufacturing
- Eliminates waste, reduces costs, improves product quality
- Key components: JIT production, Jidouka, Kaizen, Poka-yoke

## Jidouka[^15]
- Automation with a human touch
- Four steps: discover, stop, fix, investigate
- Implementation challenges in Uzbekistan's industries


## Just-in-Time (JIT)[^16]
- Inventory management strategy
- Reduces inventory costs, waste, increases efficiency
- Application in Uzbekistan's industrial sector


## TPS, Industrial Analytics, Industry 4.0 and Uzbekistan
- Evolution of TPS with modern technologies and techniques
- Aligning with Industry 4.0 in Uzbekistan
- Benefits of TPS and modern technologies for Uzbekistan

## Conclusion
- Adopting TPS and modern production management approaches
- Continuous improvement and employee empowerment
- Opportunities for Uzbekistan to improve industrial efficiency and enter Industry 4.0
